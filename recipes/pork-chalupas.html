                <li>1 (4 pound) pork shoulder roast</li>
                <li>1 pound dried pinto beans</li>
                <li>3 (4 ounce) cans diced green chile peppers</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
                <li>16 gluten free tortillas</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the roast inside a slow cooker 
                    coated with cooking spray. In a separate 
                    bowl, stir together the beans, 2 cans of 
                    the chile peppers, chili powder, cumin, 
                    salt, oregano, and garlic powder. Pour 
                    the whole mixture over the roast, and 
                    add enough water so that the roast is 
                    mostly covered. Jiggle the roast a little 
                    to get some of the liquid underneath.</li>
                <li>Cover, and cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours. 
                    Check after about 5 hours to make sure the 
                    beans have not absorbed all of the liquid. 
                    Add more water if necessary 1 cup at a time. 
                    Use just enough to keep the beans from drying 
                    out.</li>
                <li>When the roast is fork-tender, remove it 
                    from the slow cooker, and place on a cutting 
                    board. Remove any bone and fat, then shred 
                    with forks. Return to the slow cooker, and 
                    stir in the remaining can of green chilies. 
                    Heat through, and serve with flour tortillas 
                    and your favorite toppings.</li>
            </ol>
