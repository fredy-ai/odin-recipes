        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I have never heard a complaint of my beef stew, it's a great new take on an old favorite! 
                I prefer to serve stew over white rice, it all depends on your taste. 
                You can season the beef with a packet of Sazon instead of salt and pepper,
                 for even more Spanish style.</p>
